# 3D-molecule-projection-with pythonðŸ§ª  
This project is for chemistry class.  

## How to use
Enter your molecule's elements one by one, but the center atom must be entered at first.  
Also, you are allowed to enter only 1st and 2nd cycles.  

## Results
You are going to earn how your molecule is shaped, and the **3D Projection** of the molecule shape.  
Or, if your molecule doesn't follow right grammer, it will return "wrong molecule".  
The center atom is red, and others are blue.(Actually, blue is above red in all conditions....ðŸ˜‚)
